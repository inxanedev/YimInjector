# download
Download the latest version from the Releases tab.

# troubleshooting
Make sure to run the program as Administrator!  
It needs the permissions to inject the downloaded DLL into the GTA process, as well as download the latest DLL into a temporary directory.

IMPORTANT: If the program doesn't launch, make sure you have .NET 8 installed on your computer. [Here is a download link.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download)
